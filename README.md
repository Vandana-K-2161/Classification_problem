# Breast Cancer Classification Project  

## Objective  

The objective of this project is  analyze and classify data related to breast cancer using various classification algorithms.  

## Dataset  

We will use the breast cancer dataset available in the `sklearn` library. This dataset includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a breast mass, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.  

## Key Components  

### 1. Loading and Preprocessing 
### 2. Classification Algorithm Implementation 
Implemented five classification algorithms to evaluate their performance on this dataset.  
### 3. Model Comparison
After training and validating all five algorithms, we compared their performance based on accuracy:  

### Conclusion  

In summary, this project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques by implementing various classification models on the breast cancer dataset.
